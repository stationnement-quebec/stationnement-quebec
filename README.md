## Dependencies

Dependencies can be installed with `npm install`, assuming you have node installed. 

togeojson also needs to be installed as a command line utility (`npm install -g togeojson`). Also because we use togeojson as a command line utility, the server is only compatible with Linux or Mac right now. 

## Server

Server can be started with 

`node server.js`
